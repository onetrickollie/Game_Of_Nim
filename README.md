# Game of Nim

This project implements the Game of Nim using a Python class that defines the game rules. The game can be played between a computer using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and a human player. This project is part of a programming assignment and serves as a foundation for implementing adversarial search algorithms.

## Game Rules

- Two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps or rows.
- In each turn, a player must remove at least one object from the same row.
- The player that removes the last object loses the game.
- The game state is represented by a list where each element denotes the number of objects in each row (e.g., `[5, 3, 1]`).

## Getting Started
